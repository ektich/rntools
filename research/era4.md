# Era 4 Research Paths

Recommended path for landmark hauling with emphasis on PAX:
 * Ares -> Neptune (60 points)
 * Neptune + all necessary upgrades for both paths (115 pints)
 * Switch to Neptune as it is better than Prometheus and Morpheus
 * Depending on priorities: Hypnos then Thor, or Thor then Hypnos
 * Experiment with Poseidon

## Passenger trains
For city hauling (10 tracks) Hypnos starts to outperform Hermes when waiting times raise above 2 minutes 15 seconds.

For landmark hauling (2/3 tracks)  Hypnos starts to outperform Hermes when waiting times raise above 45 seconds. Artemis starts to outperform Hermes when WT raise above 2 minutes.

### Hermes
 * Apollo -> Hermes: 45 + 12 + 10 + 11 = **78**

### Hypnos (multislot passenger engine)
#### Apollo -> Neptune -> Hypnos
 * Apollo -> Neptune: 45 + 16 + 7 + 12 = 80
 * Neptune -> Hypnos: 55 + 12 + 7 + 10 = 84
 * Total: **164**

#### Ares -> Neptune -> Hypnos
 * Ares -> Neptune: 30 + 16 + 7 + 7 = 60
 * Neptune -> Hypnos: 55 + 12 + 7 + 10 = 84
 * Total: **144**

#### Ares -> Horus -> Hypnos
 * Ares -> Horus: 30 + 6 + 5 = 41
 * Horus -> Hypnos: 40 + 15 + 13 + 13 + 12 = 93
 * Total: **134**

## Cargo trains
On schedules with lots of stops, but all connections under 3 tracks Ares is better and both Prometheus and Morpheus. On anything else Morpheus is better (not worth switching)

Thor and Poseidon are top trains for this era, at least for waiting times below 5 minutes. Thor seems to be a better engine if WTs are below 2:30/3:00 minutes.

On WT above 5 minutes Apollo might be a better engine.

### Apollo -> Neptune -> Thor
 * Apollo -> Neptune: 45 + 16 + 7 + 12 = 80
 * Neptune -> Thor: 55 + 18 + 13 = 86
 * Total: **166**

### Apollo -> Hermes -> Thor
 * Apollo -> Hermes: 45 + 12 + 10 + 11 = 78
 * Hermes -> Thor: 50 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 8 +6 = 90
 * Total: **168**

### Ares -> Neptune -> Thor
 * Ares -> Neptune: 30 + 16 + 7 + 7 = 60
 * Neptune -> Thor: 55 + 18 + 13 = 86
 * Total: **146**
