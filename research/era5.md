# Era 5 Research Paths

It is worth fully researching and switching to Medusas.

Also it appears that Leviathan is a better overall engine, if you have a Plus package. Without Plus package pick "Talos" route and switch to Centaurs.

## Basilisk -> Satyr -> Talos -> Centraur
(assuming Basilisk is already researched)
 * Basilisk -> Satyr: 19 + 8 = 27
 * Satyr -> Talos: 70 + 20 + 11 + 18 = 119
 * Talos -> Centaur: 80 + 25 + 22 + 16 = 143
 * Total: **289**
## Basilisk -> Aten -> Leviathan -> Centaur
(assuming Basilisk is already researched)
 * Basilisk -> Aten: 15 + 15 + 11 = 41
 * Aten -> Leviathan: 75 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 14 = 143
 * Leviathan -> Centaur: 75 + 25 + 10 + 28 + 30 = 168
 * Total: **352**

## Passenger trains
Talos is better on short tracks (4 tracks two ways, on WT of 2min), Aten is much better as inter-city hauler (more than 5 tracks each way), but even on long distances with Talos is better at high WTs
